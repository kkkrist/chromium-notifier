# Chromium Update Notifications

This extension will periodically check [Woolyss' website](https://chromium.woolyss.com/) and display a "New" icon badge once the version found for the selected platform/tag is different to the one you're currently using. Nothing more, nothing less.

As of version 1.1.0, tracking and 1-click-installing of updates for all installed extensions is also supported (those which support auto-updating). Just be aware that to make this work, a list of your installed extensions will need to be periodically transmitted to the [chromium-extension-service](https://github.com/kkkrist/chromium-extension-service).

As of version 1.4.0, all installed extensions can be enabled/disabled via a checkbox next to it in the list. Quickly enable/disable extensions you rarely use to increase privacy and browser speed.

## Configuration

Click on the extension's icon, select platform (mac, win32 or win64) and tag â€“ i.e. the Chromium version you're using and enable tracking of extension updates if desired.

To enable 1-click installation of extension updates, you need to set the flag `chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling` to "Always prompt for install".
